The material displays deep, saturated folds with highlights of warm orange where sunlight directly strikes, while shadowed areas reveal subtle burgundy undertones. The wooden frame shows polished mahogany with ornate Baroque scrollwork, gleaming with reflected light. The fabric appears dry and matte, with a luxurious texture that absorbs and diffuses the bright indoor illumination.",

The glossy black beak reflects sharp points of white light, while the eyes gleam with painted highlights that suggest life. The surface shows a delicate varnish that creates a warm, amber glow where sunlight strikes, while recessed areas remain in cool, deep shadows. Fine Baroque detailing in the sculpted feathers shows intricate texture work.",

The fabric shows visible threads and knots that catch the light, creating a tactile surface with deep crevices in shadow. The material appears dry and slightly dusty, with subtle highlights of pale gold where the sun directly illuminates the coarse fibers. The canvas shows Baroque attention to material truth, with frayed edges and natural wear patterns adding authentic character.",
