The folding chair is positioned directly next to both the cat and the goat, creating a triangular arrangement where the cat rests beside the goat, and the goat stands adjacent to the cat, all bathed in the soft, fading evening light that casts long shadows and highlights textures of fur, wood, and keratin.
