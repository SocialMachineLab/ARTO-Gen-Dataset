        "main_prompt": "A Baroque painting depicting a majestic, alert elephant with warm gray skin and amber highlights, its leathery hide cast in deep violet shadows, standing beside a freshly baked loaf of golden amber bread with rich caramel brown crust, which sits next to a lush, vibrant potted plant in emerald green foliage within a warm terracotta ceramic pot. The elephant, dominant in scale, is positioned between the bread and the plant, forming a triangular composition in the midground of a sun-drenched courtyard during a bright, active, cheerful afternoon. Harsh natural sunlight streams from the upper left, creating dramatic chiaroscuro contrasts that define the elephant's muscular form, illuminate the bread's textured surface, and accentuate the plant's vibrant leaves, all set against classical architectural elements with deep shadows and luminous highlights characteristic of Baroque theatricality.",
