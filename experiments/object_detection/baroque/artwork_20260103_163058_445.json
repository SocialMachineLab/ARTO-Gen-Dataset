In the foreground, a pristine and well-preserved creamy white doll with rosy pink accents sits beside a large, aged and functional sink in cool gray and earthy beige tones. Next to the sink stands a small, handcrafted and sturdy mare carved from rich mahogany wood with warm amber highlights. The doll is positioned next to the sink, the mare stands next to the sink, and the doll is also placed next to the mare, creating a triangular composition of porcelain, stone, and wood textures. The morning light streams in dramatically, casting deep shadows and brilliant highlights that accentuate the creamy porcelain of the doll, the weathered stone of the sink, and the polished wood grain of the mare, creating a fresh, energetic, and striking Baroque atmosphere full of dynamic contrast and theatrical energy.",
