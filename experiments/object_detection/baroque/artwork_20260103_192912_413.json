Its wings are etched with intricate filigree that creates sharp, angular shadows, while its eyes are inlaid with deep garnet stones that appear almost black in the dim atmosphere. The rainy humidity has caused a fine patina of moisture to settle on its surface, giving it a subtle, dewy sheen that enhances the moody, mysterious quality.",

Its surface is textured with thick, napped fibers that absorb light rather than reflect it, creating a soft, matte appearance. The rainy, humid air has caused the fabric to become slightly damp, making the colors appear deeper and more saturated, with subtle variations in tone where moisture has settled into the folds.",
