            "simple": "A Baroque painting of a sword on an oven with a faucet beside it in a calm, dramatic evening interior.",
            "complex": "A Baroque painting depicting a calm yet striking domestic scene in the evening. In the foreground, a large, aged but functional oven in deep brick red and dark umber dominates the composition. Resting atop its worn surface is a medium-sized sword of warm steel gray and golden bronze, its blade well-maintained with a noble patina. Beside the oven, a small, polished faucet gleams in warm gold and rich amber hues, with delicate beads of condensation catching the artificial, dramatic light. The scene is bathed in the warm glow of evening, with chiaroscuro lighting creating deep shadows and brilliant highlights that enhance the textures of steel, bronze, gold, and brick. The atmosphere is both relaxed and visually arresting, capturing a moment of serene stillness where ordinary objects are transformed into subjects of quiet grandeur.",
