            "simple": "A Baroque painting of a knife on a glass jar beside a sleigh in dramatic evening lighting.",
            "complex": "A Baroque painting depicting a serene evening interior scene with dramatic artificial lighting. In the foreground, a large decorative sleigh in crimson and gold leaf sits pristine and majestic, positioned beside a medium-sized amber glass jar of pristine crystal clarity. Resting atop the glass jar is a medium-sized knife with a warm silver and golden blade, polished and well-maintained. The composition creates a striking yet calm atmosphere through chiaroscuro lighting that highlights the reflective surfaces of steel, silver, and crystal glass against rich velvet textures and dark wood surroundings. The artificial light source casts deep shadows and brilliant highlights, emphasizing the luxurious materials and creating a relaxed, contemplative mood with Baroque theatricality.",
