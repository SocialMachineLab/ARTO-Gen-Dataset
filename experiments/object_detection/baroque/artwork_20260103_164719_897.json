The cup's glaze reflects tiny, shimmering points of light, creating a luminous quality that embodies the fresh energy of dawn. Fine cobalt blue decorative motifs, painted with Baroque flourish, appear slightly muted yet rich against the creamy background, their edges softened by the ambient atmospheric haze. A faint wisp of steam rises from within, catching the light and dissolving into the bright air.",
