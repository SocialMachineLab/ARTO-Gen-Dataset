The muted illumination reveals subtle variations in the crimson and amber tones of its painted skin, with soft highlights where the wax catches the light. A delicate dusting of powdered pigment simulates natural bloom, while the stem and leaf display fine veining rendered in muted olive and umber tones that appear velvety in the subdued atmosphere.",

The cool, diffused afternoon light catches the glossy varnish on the brass buttons and the smooth finish of the dark wood base, creating subtle reflections.

The cloudy sky's cool illumination softens the richness of the dyes, creating a velvety, matte appearance in the dark areas while the metallic threads catch faint glimmers. The fabric's weight and texture are visible in the gentle folds, with the pile appearing plush and inviting, the colors appearing more saturated and jewel-like against the subdued atmosphere.",
