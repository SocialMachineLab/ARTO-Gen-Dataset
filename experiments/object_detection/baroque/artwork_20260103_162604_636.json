The golden surface glows with a rich, honeyed patina, while the deep black marble base absorbs the light, creating dramatic shadows in the crevices of its carved acanthus leaves. The clock face, made of aged porcelain with hand-painted Roman numerals, reflects soft amber highlights on its convex glass cover, giving the appearance of liquid gold suspended within.",

The leather shows subtle wear and a lustrous sheen where the oil from handling has polished the surface over time.
