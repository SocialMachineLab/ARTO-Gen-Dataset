Their hides display rich umber and chestnut tones with subtle violet undertones from the cool ambient air. The animals appear well-fed and dignified, with muscular forms rendered in thick, impasto brushstrokes. Their coats catch the flickering light with velvety matte texture, while their dark, liquid eyes reflect tiny points of warm illumination. A gentle haze softens their outlines, creating an ethereal, allegorical quality. Their horns gleam with subdued amber highlights against the muted background.",
