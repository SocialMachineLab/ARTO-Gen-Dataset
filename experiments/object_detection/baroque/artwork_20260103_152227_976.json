The stone's surface shows subtle variations from creamy ivory to pure white, with the bright light revealing the intricate carving of individual fleece strands and the soft, rounded forms of the body. Strong shadows define the folds and contours, creating dramatic chiaroscuro effects.

In the foreground, a large, well-polished dining table of deep mahogany brown with warm amber highlights dominates the composition.

Beside the table, in the midground, stands a medium-sized, creamy white marble lamb sculpture with warm ivory tones, its carved form positioned next to the table's edge. The atmosphere is active and cheerful, illuminated by harsh, natural afternoon light streaming through a window, creating dramatic contrasts of light and shadow that define the textures of the silver, wood, and marble, and enhancing the dynamic, theatrical quality of the Baroque style.",
