            "simple": "A Baroque painting of a bottle, wheel, and mare arranged in a calm evening scene with dramatic lighting.",
            "complex": "A Baroque painting depicting a calm evening scene with striking artificial lighting. In the foreground, a medium-sized, aged and dusty bottle of deep emerald green glass with warm amber highlights sits next to a medium-sized, weathered wheel of warm honey oak wood with dark sienna iron fittings, both possessing a noble patina. Behind both objects, a large, majestic mare of deep chestnut brown and rich umber stands calmly, her horsehair and flesh rendered with soft texture. The spatial arrangement shows the bottle positioned beside the wheel, with the mare situated behind them both, creating a triangular composition. The atmosphere is calm and relaxed yet visually striking, illuminated by dramatic artificial light that casts deep shadows and highlights the textures of glass, wood, and horsehair in the evening stillness.",
