The gilded accents catch the flickering light with theatrical brilliance, creating dancing highlights across elaborate scrollwork and acanthus leaf carvings. Polished brass fittings gleam with a soft, buttery luminance, while the dark mahogany base absorbs the light, revealing subtle variations in the rich stain. The surface maintains a dignified patina appropriate to the early modern period, with gentle wear on high points adding character. The warm artificial lighting enhances the dramatic chiaroscuro across its sculptural form, making the ornate details appear almost alive with shadow and light.",
