The filling bubbles through the vents, glowing with amber and ruby tones where the sun catches the translucent apple slices.

The fur has a luminous, almost translucent quality at the edges, catching light with a gentle glow. Its dark, liquid eyes reflect the bright atmosphere with deep, mysterious pools of shadow.
