'Side-lit' is the classic setup for creating depth and volume in Baroque compositions. The 'dramatic' quality comes from the contrast between the illuminated objects (boy, pie, knife) and the deep shadows in the room. The 'warm' mood is derived from the 'afternoon' time, which imbues the light with a golden hue, contrasting beautifully with the cool shadows and enhancing the richness of the scene."
