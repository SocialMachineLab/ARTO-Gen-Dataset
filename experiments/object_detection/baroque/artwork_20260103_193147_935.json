Beside the cow's front hooves rests a small, exquisite comb of warm cream and golden ivory. The composition is dramatically illuminated by artificial light sources that cast deep shadows and highlight the porcelain-like quality of the cow, the bronze texture of the sea lion, and the delicate ivory of the comb. The atmosphere is calm and relaxed yet visually striking, with the theatrical Baroque lighting creating a sense of quiet grandeur against the deepening evening sky.",
