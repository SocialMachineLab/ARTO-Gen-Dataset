            "simple": "A Baroque painting of a donkey and lion resting together on a crimson blanket at dusk.",
            "complex": "A Baroque painting depicting a calm evening scene where a large ochre and umber donkey sits calmly and still upon a crimson and gold blanket, its body draped in soft fur, while next to it rests a dominant golden and burnt sienna lion, regal and composed with a majestic mane, both animals sharing the same velvet-textured blanket that is settled upon the ground. The spatial arrangement places the donkey and lion side by side in the foreground, their forms illuminated by a mixed dramatic lighting that casts deep shadows and highlights their textures against the twilight sky. The atmosphere is calm and relaxed yet strikingly powerful, with the evening light creating a chiaroscuro effect that enhances the rich crimson of the blanket and the warm hues of the animals, all set within a serene natural environment where the quiet of dusk envelops the scene.",
