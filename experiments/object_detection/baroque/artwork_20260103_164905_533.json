The fabric displays deep, velvety shadows in the crevices while raised areas shimmer with warm highlights. Natural light reveals the subtle sheen of silk threads woven into intricate brocade patterns, creating a play of light and dark that emphasizes the material's luxurious weight and texture.

The wood grain shows warm amber tones where light strikes directly, while recessed areas remain in cool, natural shadow. The metal axle gleams with a bright, silvery flash, contrasting against the darker wood. Morning clarity reveals fine tool marks and the precise craftsmanship of the turned spokes, each casting delicate linear shadows that speak of Baroque attention to detail.",
