The polished metal surface reflects flickering candle flames with a soft, luminous glow, while the surrounding darkness of the palace entrance makes the illuminated portions appear to float with divine radiance. Fine engraved lettering gleams with metallic brilliance against the patinated background, each curve of the ornate frame catching light in a cascade of warm tones.",

A 'mixed' lighting setup (dim natural light from evening fading outside + warm artificial light from chandeliers/sconces inside) creates this effect. 'Side-lighting' highlights the texture of stone walls and the sign, creating depth and volume, essential for the Baroque aesthetic."
