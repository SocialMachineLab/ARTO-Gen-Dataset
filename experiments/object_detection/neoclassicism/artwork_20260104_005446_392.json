Fine droplets of condensation cling to the fabric's waxy surface, creating tiny prismatic glints where the mixed lighting refracts through them.",

Delicate gold leaf trim along the rigging catches the light in thin, luminous threads, and the entire vessel appears suspended in a gentle haze that softens its edges.",

Its crimson coat deepens to burgundy in shadow while catching muted highlights of burnt sienna where the mixed light strikes its rounded form.
