The feathers display a sophisticated interplay of deep charcoal blacks and iridescent midnight blues, with individual barbs catching highlights that shift to warm slate-gray where the sun strikes directly. Its long neck arches with sculptural grace, the skin showing subtle texture in pearlescent gray tones, while its powerful legs gleam with a matte finish in weathered sepia and bone white. The beak catches the light with a polished obsidian sheen, and the eye reflects a bright spark of morning illumination, rendered with the careful observation of natural history studies favored in contemporary neoclassical works.",
