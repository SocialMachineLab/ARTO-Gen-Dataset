            "complex": "A Neoclassicism painting depicting a bright and active afternoon scene with a gentle, cheerful atmosphere. In the foreground, a large, sun-warmed blanket in warm ochre and burnt sienna tones is draped elegantly atop a medium-sized, polished blade that gleams with silver and steel blue reflections. Beside this arrangement, a medium-sized dog with luminous amber and honey-colored fur stands alert, its posture noble and watchful. The natural soft afternoon light bathes the composition in a warm glow, highlighting the wool texture of the blanket, the cold steel of the blade, and the soft fur of the dog. The scene is organized with classical balance and clarity, evoking a sense of serene activity and harmonious contrast between the organic and metallic elements.",
