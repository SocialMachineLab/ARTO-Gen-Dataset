The natural illumination intensifies its vibrant citrus hue, creating a striking contrast against the more muted classical surroundings.

The afternoon sun catches the polished metal fittings, creating warm golden reflections that dance across its surface. The canvas envelope appears dry and taut, rendered in muted cream tones that absorb and soften the light, while the varnished wooden frame shows rich amber undertones.
