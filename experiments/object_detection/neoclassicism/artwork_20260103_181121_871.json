The dark brown and black feathers have a subtle iridescent quality, catching warm highlights of russet and bronze along the wing edges.

Its dark hide has a matte, velvety texture that absorbs light, creating dramatic chiaroscuro across its broad shoulders and thick neck.

The natural canvas tone is warmed to a soft beige-tan, with darker shadows in the folds where light cannot reach. Leather straps and trim have developed a rich patina, showing warm amber and chestnut tones where oils have been worked into the material.
