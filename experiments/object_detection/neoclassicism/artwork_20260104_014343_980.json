Flaky layers create subtle shadows that reveal the texture, while a light dusting of sugar sparkles like tiny crystals in the sunbeams. The surface shows a gentle sheen where light reflects off buttery surfaces, with rich amber tones deepening in the crevices.

The fur shows subtle variations of amber and chestnut tones, with a gentle matte texture that absorbs rather than reflects the bright interior light.

Beside the elephant, a medium-sized cat with warm amber and honey-gold fur sits alert and graceful, observing the scene with poised elegance. The composition is arranged with the elephant and pastry dominating the foreground, the cat positioned slightly to the side in the midground, and a classical architectural backdrop with marble columns and soft drapery in the background. The afternoon light casts natural, soft illumination across the scene, creating a bright, active, and cheerful atmosphere with gentle shadows that enhance the sculptural quality of the forms. The overall mood is one of harmonious whimsy, blending classical dignity with playful charm.",
