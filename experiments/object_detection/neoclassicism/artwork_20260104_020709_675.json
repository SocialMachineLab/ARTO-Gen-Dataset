Upon the sack rests a small, freshly bloomed crimson rose with deep burgundy undertones, its perfect petals catching the afternoon light. The spatial arrangement creates a balanced composition where the scissors are positioned immediately next to the sack, and the rose sits centered atop the sack's folded surface. The atmosphere is active and cheerful, with sharp contrasts from the harsh lighting emphasizing the textures of burlap, steel, and delicate petals against a classical architectural background.",
