The afternoon's cloudy illumination softens the glossy varnish, creating subtle highlights along the curved stern and bow. Delicate rigging threads are taut and perfectly aligned, while miniature brass fittings gleam with restrained metallic warmth against the cool ambient light.

The cloudy daylight filtering through the gallery renders his weathered complexion in muted olive tones with soft gray shadows in the folds of his sculpted clothing. His woolen sweater appears as carved texture with matte cream surfaces that absorb rather than reflect light, while his face shows the neoclassical emphasis on calm, noble expression.
