                "artistic_description": "A pristine white swan rendered with classical sculptural grace, its plumage catching the warm afternoon sunlight streaming through the window. The feathers display subtle variations of ivory and cream where light strikes, while shadows reveal delicate gray undertones. Its curved neck forms an elegant S-curve, with the beak glowing in soft amber tones. The eye appears as a dark, polished obsidian bead reflecting a pinpoint of bright light. The surface of the feathers has a soft, matte texture that diffuses the light gently, creating a luminous halo effect around the bird's form.",

The material glows with a warm, golden radiance where the sun directly strikes it, while areas in shadow reveal a subtle rosy blush tone. The surface has a gentle sheen that creates soft specular highlights, giving it an ethereal, almost marble-like quality. The thin tether or neck of the balloon catches the light as a fine silver line. The balloon's form is perfectly spherical, with the light passing through it creating a subtle inner glow that suggests captured sunlight.",
