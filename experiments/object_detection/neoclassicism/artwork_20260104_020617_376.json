The creature appears almost sculptural, with crisp, clean lines defining its form. Its coat is rendered in soft silvery-gray tones, warmed by the golden afternoon light, with subtle highlights dancing along its spine and flanks. The whiskers are rendered as fine, precise lines, almost like etched silver filaments. Its eyes catch the bright sunlight as tiny polished obsidian gems, reflecting the azure sky. The overall appearance is one of classical idealization - not a common field mouse, but an elevated, almost aristocratic rodent, its form balanced and harmonious. The fur appears dry and velvety in the bright, cheerful atmosphere, with each hair subtly defined in the clear, crisp air of the afternoon.",
