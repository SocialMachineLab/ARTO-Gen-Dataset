The label displays crisp neoclassical typography in rich burgundy and cream, rendered with mathematical precision against the glass. Light dances across the curved surface in bright specular highlights, revealing the flawless clarity of contemporary glasswork. A delicate meniscus of liquid creates a subtle refraction at the neck, and the cork's wax seal bears the maker's mark pressed with classical authority. The glass possesses a subtle greenish cast where light passes through its thick base, while the shoulder catches bright white reflections from the gallery's track lighting.",
