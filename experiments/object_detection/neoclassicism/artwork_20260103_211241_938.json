The afternoon sun reveals subtle color variations in the plumage - from deep charcoal to silvery gray - with each feather defined by sharp highlights and delicate shadows. Its long neck catches the light dramatically, creating a graceful arc of alternating light and shadow, while the eye gleams with a sharp, intelligent highlight.

            "complex": "A Neoclassicism painting depicting a bright and active afternoon scene with harsh natural lighting. In the foreground, a calm, stationary donkey of medium size stands next to a large, alert ostrich, both positioned before a dignified lamp post. The donkey's sun-bleached gray and warm taupe hide contrasts with the ostrich's charcoal gray and silver-white feathers, while the large, warm bronze-gold lamp post rises behind them, its sunlit amber glass and well-maintained patina catching the cheerful afternoon light. The spatial arrangement clearly shows the donkey beside the ostrich, with the lamp post situated behind both animals, casting subtle shadows that enhance the scene's classical composition and vibrant, cheerful atmosphere.",
