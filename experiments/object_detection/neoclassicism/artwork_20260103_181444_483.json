Beside this arrangement, a pair of medium-sized scissors in cool steel gray with warm amber brown handles lies with a gentle patina, positioned next to the schooner. The natural soft lighting creates a bright yet subdued atmosphere, casting gentle shadows that highlight the precise details of the wooden schooner, the textured surface of the freshly baked bread, and the well-preserved steel of the scissors. The overall scene feels both active in its careful arrangement and gentle in its quiet, classical dignity, with materials of steel, wood, and bread harmonizing under the afternoon glow.",

            "simple": "A Neoclassical still life with scissors beside a schooner resting on bread in soft afternoon light.",
            "complex": "A Neoclassicism painting depicting a carefully arranged still life composition in the soft afternoon light. In the foreground, a meticulously crafted small schooner of deep mahogany with soft ivory sails rests upon a medium-sized loaf of warm golden brown bread with a creamy off-white interior, its firm crust supporting the vessel. Beside this arrangement, a pair of medium-sized scissors in cool steel gray with warm amber brown handles lies with a gentle patina, positioned next to the schooner. The natural soft lighting creates a bright yet subdued atmosphere, casting gentle shadows that highlight the precise details of the wooden schooner, the textured surface of the freshly baked bread, and the well-preserved steel of the scissors. The overall scene feels both active in its careful arrangement and gentle in its quiet, classical dignity, with materials of steel, wood, and bread harmonizing under the afternoon glow.",
