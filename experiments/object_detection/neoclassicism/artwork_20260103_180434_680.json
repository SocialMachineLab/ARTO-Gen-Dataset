In the foreground, a large, partially filled sack in warm ochre and natural beige burlap drapes naturally over a small pair of brilliant silver scissors with warm brown wooden handles, the scissors sharp and ready for use. Directly above this arrangement on a classical wall, a medium-sized, brilliant white wall clock with polished brass accents hangs, functioning and well-maintained, its face catching the morning light. The spatial composition clearly shows the sack resting atop the scissors, with the wall clock positioned above both objects, creating a vertical arrangement against a simple Neoclassical interior with clean architectural lines and morning sunlight streaming through a window.",
