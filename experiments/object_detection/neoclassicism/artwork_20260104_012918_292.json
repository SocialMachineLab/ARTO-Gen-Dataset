The fruit's blush of crimson along one side glows warmly in the bright interior light, while the stem shows a matte, woody brown with fine texture. The skin appears smooth yet slightly dimpled, with highlights dancing across its curved surface in the gentle, active atmosphere.",

The wooden spokes show rich mahogany tones with subtle grain patterns visible in the bright, gentle illumination, while the central hub features ornate neoclassical detailing with a weathered patina that speaks to contemporary craftsmanship.
