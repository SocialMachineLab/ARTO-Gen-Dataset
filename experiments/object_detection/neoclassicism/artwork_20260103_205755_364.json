            "complex": "A Neoclassicism painting depicting a morning scene arranged with classical precision and harmonious balance. In the foreground, a dominant piece of well-worn but dignified luggage in warm amber and deep mahogany leather with brass fittings provides the compositional foundation. Upon its flat surface sits a medium-sized clock in brilliant gold and pure white enamel, immaculately kept with gilded bronze detailing. Beside the clock rests a small comb of creamy ivory and soft pearl, pristine and polished. Natural soft morning light streams into the space, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the textures of leather, ivory, and gilded metal. The overall atmosphere is fresh, energetic, cheerful, and gentle, evoking the quiet optimism of a new day's beginning with neoclassical clarity and restrained elegance.",
