In the foreground, a medium-sized backpack in warm brown and deep amber leather sits atop a medium-sized wheel made of weathered oak with charcoal iron fittings, the backpack's softened leather showing gentle wear. Beside this arrangement stands a large, calm sheep with creamy white and soft gray wool, its clean fleece catching the morning light. The spatial composition clearly shows the backpack resting on the sturdy, functional wheel while the serene sheep stands adjacent to this central grouping.
