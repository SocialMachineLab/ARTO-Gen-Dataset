The wool appears freshly cleaned, with natural lanolin giving subtle sheen where sunlight strikes. Its dark, intelligent eyes reflect the bright room with gentle amber tones. The muzzle shows delicate pinkish-gray skin peeking through shorter wool, while hooves are polished dark keratin. The overall appearance is one of robust health and pastoral purity, rendered with classical attention to naturalistic form and textural contrast.",

The leather shows fine grain and subtle tooling details rendered with neoclassical precision. Brass or silver fittings gleam with crisp reflections, creating small points of bright light against the matte leather. The seat displays gentle wear patterns, suggesting practical use while maintaining dignified elegance. Stitching appears precise and sturdy, with threads catching light as fine golden lines. The overall composition balances functional durability with refined craftsmanship.",
