                "artistic_description": "A classical spear shaft glows with warm amber tones under artificial stage lighting, its polished wood grain catching the light in elegant parallel lines reminiscent of neoclassical fluting. The metallic spearhead gleams with a cool, silvery brilliance, its polished surface creating sharp highlights and deep shadows that emphasize its geometric precision. The bronze ferrule connecting shaft to blade shows subtle verdigris patina in the crevices, while the polished edges catch the light like facets of a gemstone. The overall appearance is one of refined antiquity, with the artificial lighting creating a dramatic chiaroscuro effect that sculpts the weapon's form.",
