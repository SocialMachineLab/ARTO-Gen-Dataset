The afternoon sun warms its surface to a rich, luminous orange with subtle golden undertones, while deep green patches near the stem show hints of olive. The thick, coarsely textured stem appears dried and woody, casting small, crisp shadows on the adjacent surface. Fine, hair-like imperfections and natural blemishes are visible, lending an authentic, rustic quality to the specimen.",

The stone's crystalline structure catches the afternoon sun, creating subtle, pearlescent highlights along the massive curves of the body and the gentle slope of the trunk. Cool, silvery shadows pool in the deep folds of the wrinkled skin, while warm golden tones caress the elevated planes. The polished ivory tusks gleam with a creamy, opalescent sheen, contrasting with the matte, finely-grained texture of the body. The overall effect is one of classical grandeur and serene monumentality.",
