                "artistic_description": "A grand, neoclassical-inspired cooker stands with architectural gravitas, its form echoing the disciplined symmetry of classical columns and pediments. Under the soft, diffused afternoon light filtering through the museum's tall windows, its polished surfaces catch gentle, cool highlights from the cloudy sky, while the recessed details remain in subtle, muted shadow. The metalwork gleams with a restrained, silvery luminosity, and the enamel surfaces possess a quiet, matte sheen that absorbs rather than reflects the ambient brightness, lending the piece a dignified, almost sculptural presence. Fine, incised lines and restrained classical motifs are rendered with delicate precision, their edges softened by the gentle, even illumination.",
