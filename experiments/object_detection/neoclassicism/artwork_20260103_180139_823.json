            "complex": "A Neoclassicism painting depicting a bright and cheerful afternoon scene in a classical garden setting. In the foreground, a large, stately lion with golden amber and deep bronze fur stands imposingly with weathered dignity. Perched atop the lion's broad back is a medium-sized toy in warm cream and soft terracotta colors, showing pristine condition with gentle wear suggesting affectionate use. Beside the lion stands an equally large Bengal tiger with a coat of burnt sienna and creamy ivory stripes, displaying gracefully aged aristocratic poise. The two majestic animals stand side-by-side in a balanced composition, with the toy creating a playful contrast against their dignified forms. Natural, even afternoon light bathes the scene, casting soft shadows across the marble terrace where they stand, with classical columns and lush greenery visible in the background. The atmosphere is active and cheerful, capturing a moment of serene companionship between these noble creatures.",
