The glass walls appear as crystalline planes with subtle greenish-blue undertones where light passes through the thickness of the material, while the rim and base catch sharp, brilliant highlights.

In the foreground, a large, alert and vital ram with warm cream and soft ivory wool stands proudly, its horns catching the morning light. Immediately beside the ram, a small, well-used but carefully maintained ladle of warm amber and rich brown aged wood rests atop a medium-sized, pristine and sparkling clean glass vase. The crystal clear vase with pale aqua undertones sits between the ram and ladle, creating a triangular composition. The ram's living wool and horn textures contrast with the ladle's aged wood and the vase's hand-blown glass surface, all arranged on a classical stone surface that suggests a pastoral setting. The cheerful atmosphere is enhanced by soft morning shadows and a sense of classical harmony in the spatial relationships.",
