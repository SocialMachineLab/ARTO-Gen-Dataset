Beside the bag, carefully folded and placed on a stone ledge, lies a medium-sized dress shirt in bright white and cool gray cotton, freshly pressed and appearing almost luminous. The composition is arranged with classical balance, the mule positioned centrally with the bag and shirt creating a harmonious triangular arrangement. Natural soft afternoon light filters through the scene, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the textures of leather, velvet-like animal coat, and crisp cotton. The atmosphere is both bright and active with subtle movement in the background foliage, yet simultaneously subdued and gentle in its overall mood, evoking the Neoclassical ideals of order, clarity, and restrained emotion within a pastoral setting.",
