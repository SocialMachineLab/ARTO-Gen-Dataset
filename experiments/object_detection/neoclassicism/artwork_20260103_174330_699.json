The fur appears dry and velvety, with individual hairs creating delicate highlights where sunlight strikes the shoulders and back. Subtle shadows fall across its form with the soft gradation characteristic of neoclassical modeling, while the eyes gleam with intelligent amber depths. The muzzle shows delicate cream-colored fur, warmed to pale gold by the ambient light.",

The crust displays a rich spectrum from deep amber to pale honey tones, with a matte, slightly textured surface that absorbs and reflects light with subtle variation. The interior crumb, visible at the edges, appears creamy and soft, with delicate air pockets rendered in the neoclassical tradition of idealized natural forms.",

The surface glistens with a subtle buttery sheen, showing warm highlights in pale gold and deeper tones of caramel where the layers are most compressed. A light dusting of sugar crystals sparkles like fine granules, catching and refracting the bright afternoon light with crystalline precision.",
