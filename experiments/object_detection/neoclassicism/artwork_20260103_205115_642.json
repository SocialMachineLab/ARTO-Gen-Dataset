            "complex": "A Neoclassicism painting depicting a calm and striking evening scene in an elegant hall. In the foreground, a large ceremonial cannon of burnished bronze and deep walnut brown sits pristine and imposing beside a dominant, elegant dining table of rich mahogany red and dark chocolate brown. On the immaculate surface of the dining table, a medium-sized eagle with brilliant bronze gold and verdigris green plumage perches heroically, its timeless form catching the artificial dramatic lighting. The composition is balanced and harmonious, with the cannon and table creating strong vertical and horizontal lines typical of Neoclassical design. The evening atmosphere is calm and relaxed yet striking, with warm artificial light casting dramatic shadows that emphasize the textures of bronze and polished wood, creating a scene of refined grandeur and quiet power.",
