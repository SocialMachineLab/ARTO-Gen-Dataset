The balloon's material appears as fine silk or parchment, rendered with smooth, idealized curves that evoke ancient amphorae. Sunlight creates subtle highlights along its upper curve while casting a soft, warm shadow below, giving it a sculptural presence. The surface has a gentle sheen, not glossy but with a refined luster appropriate to noble materials, and the color is a rich, saturated hue intensified by the clear, bright atmosphere.",
