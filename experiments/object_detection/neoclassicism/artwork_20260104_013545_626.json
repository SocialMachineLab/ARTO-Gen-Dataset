        "main_prompt": "A Neoclassicism painting depicting a bright and active afternoon scene with a gentle, cheerful atmosphere. In the foreground, a large, pristine schooner with brilliant white sails and warm honey-wood hull sits display-ready in calm waters. Upon its polished deck rests medium-sized luggage of deep mahogany brown with golden amber accents, appearing well-maintained yet weathered with age. Floating gracefully behind the schooner in the midground is a medium-sized balloon, fully inflated and buoyant, its latex surface a saturated crimson with warm coral highlights catching the soft natural afternoon light. The spatial arrangement creates a harmonious composition where the luggage rests securely on the schooner's deck while the vibrant balloon hovers slightly behind the vessel, all bathed in the gentle illumination of late afternoon that enhances the scene's cheerful, active yet refined Neoclassical sensibility.",
