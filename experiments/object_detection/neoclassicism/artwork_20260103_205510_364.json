            "complex": "A Neoclassicism painting depicting a vibrant and lively noon scene under harsh natural sunlight. In the foreground stands a large, polished bronze lamp post with warm golden tones and cool shadow accents, meticulously maintained. Perched atop the lamp post's ornate capital rests a small, fresh plum with deep violet-purple skin and crimson undertones, appearing ripe and vivid against the metal. Beside the lamp post in the midground, a medium-sized tiger with stylized, symbolic presence lounges, its fur rendered in warm ochre-orange and deep umber-black stripes. The composition balances classical symmetry with dramatic lighting, casting sharp shadows that emphasize the textures of bronze, fruit skin, and stylized fur, all within a clear, atmospheric setting that evokes both grandeur and vitality.",
