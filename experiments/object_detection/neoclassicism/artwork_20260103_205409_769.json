In the foreground, a large, alert mule with a warm amber and deep sienna coat stands attentively, its powerful form rendered with classical precision. Resting upon the mule's back is a small, well-used comb of honey brown and golden amber wood, polished smooth from use. Beside the mule, a medium-sized goat in cream and warm buff colors moves with active, alert energy, its curved horns catching the harsh natural afternoon light. The spatial arrangement shows the mule positioned next to the goat, with the comb clearly placed on the mule's back, creating a triangular composition of living hide, hair, and horn. The atmosphere is active and cheerful, with sharp shadows and brilliant highlights characteristic of harsh afternoon illumination, all rendered in the clean lines, balanced composition, and idealized forms of Neoclassical art.",
