            "complex": "A Post-Impressionism painting depicting a vibrant afternoon scene where a sun-drenched canopy in dominant cadmium yellow and deep violet creates a glistening shelter. Underneath this radiant structure, positioned inside its protective shade, rests a medium-sized falcon in burnt sienna and ultramarine plumage, appearing alert and vibrant as it surveys its surroundings. The spatial arrangement places the falcon clearly beneath and within the canopy's coverage, creating a focal point of life under shelter. The afternoon light filters through in natural, dappled patterns that shift between harsh brightness and soft shadows, casting dynamic shapes across the scene. The atmosphere is bright, active, and cheerful, with visible brushstrokes capturing the energy of the moment\u2014feathers and keratin details on the falcon contrasting with the textured surface of the canopy, all rendered in the expressive, color-focused style of Post-Impressionism with visible impasto and deliberate compositional balance.",
