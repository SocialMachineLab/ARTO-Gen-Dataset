The clothing appears as patches of warm, subdued color\u2014faded reds and deep browns\u2014applied with visible, textured strokes that suggest worn fabric. His face is a study in warm shadows and highlights, the cloudy sky creating a gentle, even illumination that eliminates harsh contrasts.

The colors are softened and desaturated by the cloudy atmosphere, giving it a dreamlike, ethereal quality. Fine cracks in the surface are suggested by delicate, linear strokes of shadow, while the overall matte finish absorbs rather than reflects the light.
