The breast feathers display a warm buff tone where sunlight strikes, while the eye gleams with a fierce amber point of light.

The surface shows subtle reflections of the surrounding green foliage and blue sky, rendered as patches of saturated color. The spout creates a dramatic dark shadow, painted in deep ultramarine and violet. The handle is rendered in warm, weathered brown with touches of rust-orange, suggesting years of use.
