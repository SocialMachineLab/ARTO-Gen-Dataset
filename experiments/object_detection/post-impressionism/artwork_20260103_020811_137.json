The foliage appears almost luminous against the terracotta pot, which glows with warm, earthy tones where light strikes directly, while shaded areas show cooler, muted browns. Leaves exhibit a waxy sheen that reflects tiny points of brilliant white light, creating a lively, textured appearance. The overall effect is one of vigorous growth and cheerful vitality, with bold, unmodulated color patches defining form rather than subtle blending.",
