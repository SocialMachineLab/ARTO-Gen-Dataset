The sunlight produces brilliant white highlights along the ridge of its back and muzzle, while the shadowed areas shift to rich chocolate and burnt sienna. Its dark, moist eyes reflect the bright sky as tiny points of cerulean blue, and its pinkish nose shows subtle lavender shadows.",

The bright overhead sunlight creates a brilliant white highlight on one side while the opposite side falls into deep, purplish shadow, making the fruit appear as a bold, circular form with no gradual transitions.
