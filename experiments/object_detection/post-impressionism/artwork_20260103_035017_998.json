                "artistic_description": "A robust bovine form rendered with bold, visible brushstrokes in creamy whites and warm ivory, its hide showing patches of soft russet brown and charcoal gray applied with thick impasto technique. The afternoon sun creates luminous highlights across its rounded flank, while deep shadows in ultramarine and violet accentuate its volumetric form. Its coat appears dry and slightly dusty from the sunny pasture, catching light with a matte, chalky texture. The animal's dark eyes gleam with reflected sky-blue highlights, and its muzzle shows subtle pinkish tones warmed by the golden light. Post-Impressionist color blocking emphasizes geometric simplifications of the form with deliberate, rhythmic strokes.",
