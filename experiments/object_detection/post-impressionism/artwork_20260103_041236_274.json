The yellow surface explodes with cadmium yellow, lemon yellow, and touches of orange where the sun hits most directly, while the opposite side falls into warm ochre shadows. The matte skin texture is suggested through short, directional strokes, and a small greenish stem nub provides a cool accent.

The afternoon light catches a subtle highlight of magenta on its rounded shoulder, while the crevice near the stem gathers into near-black shadows.

In the foreground, a brilliant white and Payne's grey clock sits atop a small, fresh and firm cadmium yellow lemon.

The composition features bold, visible brushstrokes characteristic of Post-Impressionism, with the metallic and glass surfaces of the clean, functional clock contrasting against the organic textures of the fruit skins. The harsh afternoon light creates strong shadows and highlights, emphasizing the geometric forms and vibrant color palette in a dynamic, visually rich arrangement.",
