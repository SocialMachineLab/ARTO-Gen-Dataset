Under the brilliant afternoon sunlight streaming through studio windows, the throne's surfaces are fractured into dynamic patches of warm ochre, deep crimson, and cool violet shadows. The natural light creates sharp, angular highlights on metallic edges while casting geometric purple shadows across the floor. The paint application is thick and textured, with visible brushstrokes that capture the energetic, cheerful atmosphere. The throne appears almost vibrating with color, its form simplified into essential shapes with strong outlines reminiscent of cloisonnism.",
