The once-vibrant colors have softened to dusty pastels - faded cerulean in the eyes, muted crimson on the lips, and antique ivory for the skin. Fine crazing in the glaze creates a delicate web of shadows, while the fabric clothing shows subtle tonal shifts from ivory to warm beige, absorbing and reflecting light with a gentle, matte softness.",

The wood grain flows in expressive, undulating patterns - deep grooves of near-black where light cannot penetrate, and ridges that shimmer with burnt orange and copper tones.
