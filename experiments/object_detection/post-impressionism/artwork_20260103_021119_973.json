Her feathers catch the mixed studio light, creating vibrant patches of warm ochre and cool slate where shadows fall. The afternoon sun streaming through windows illuminates her form with a golden halo, while her comb glows with saturated crimson. Her eyes are painted as dark, intelligent jewels with a spark of reflected light. The texture of her feathers is suggested through thick impasto application, giving a tactile quality that seems to ruffle with each movement.",
