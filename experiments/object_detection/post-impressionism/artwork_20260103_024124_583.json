Sunlight catches on splintered edges and worn metal runners, creating sharp highlights against deep, warm shadows.

The rim catches brilliant white highlights, while the interior shows deep, jewel-toned shadows in emerald and sapphire. Tiny bubbles trapped in the glass create subtle distortions, and the curved surface reflects distorted patches of the bright sky and surrounding colors.",
