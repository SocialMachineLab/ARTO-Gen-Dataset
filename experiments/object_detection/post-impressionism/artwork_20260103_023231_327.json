The bright studio lighting reveals subtle variations in the plush texture, with warm amber tones glowing where the light penetrates the fur, while the plastic eyes reflect sharp white highlights. The toy shows gentle compression and slight matting in the fur from handling.",

The waxy surface creates sharp specular highlights that flash with pure white, while the deep shadows between petals reveal rich burgundy and purple tones.
