Dominating the composition is a well-used but maintained billiard table in deep emerald and burnt umber felt, its slate bed and wooden frame visible. Draped directly upon its felt surface is a slightly worn and softened blanket in muted ochre and dusty rose wool. Beside the table, a large lamp post in gunmetal gray and bruised purple stands sentinel, its industrial metal and glass finish showing weathered patches. The entire scene is bathed in dramatic artificial light from the lamp, casting long, expressive shadows and creating a pool of illumination that highlights the textures of wool, metal, and felt against the enveloping darkness of night. The atmosphere is one of hushed stillness and enigmatic narrative, rendered with the characteristic bold brushstrokes, vivid color contrasts, and emotional intensity of the Post-Impressionist style.",
