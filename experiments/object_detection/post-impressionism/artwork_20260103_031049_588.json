                "artistic_description": "A compact wooden toy boat rendered in bold, saturated strokes with a bright red hull that glows warmly in the afternoon sun, its surface catching sharp highlights where the natural light strikes the curved form. The white cabin shows subtle variations of cream and pale yellow in the sunlight, with visible brushwork suggesting the texture of painted wood. A dark blue stripe runs along the waterline, its edges slightly softened by the bright ambient light. The plastic fishing rod gleams with a cool, glassy reflection, while the yellow plastic fish tied to its line creates a vivid accent of pure, unmodulated color. The overall effect captures the cheerful simplicity of childhood play through Post-Impressionist color intensity and visible, confident brushstrokes.",

The painted cheeks glow with a warm pink flush, while the blue eyes appear deep and saturated against the bright indoor atmosphere. The white dress is not pure white but a mosaic of pale yellow, cream, and soft blue strokes that convey both the fabric's texture and the way natural light diffuses across its surface. The golden hair is built up with thick, visible strokes of yellow ochre and amber, creating a halo effect in the bright room. The overall appearance is one of gentle luminosity, with the doll's smooth ceramic surface contrasting against the textured paint application.",

The sail is a bold expanse of pure white, built up with thick, textured strokes that suggest the tautness of fabric, with touches of warm cream where the sun hits most directly. The blue waterline stripe is intense and saturated, its edges crisp against the luminous white. The mast stands as a thin vertical stroke of bright yellow, catching the eye and adding structural energy to the composition. The transparent plastic base creates subtle refractions of light, adding depth and a sense of watery movement to the toy's presence. The painting style emphasizes the object's simple geometric forms through visible, confident brushwork and unmodulated color fields.",

        "main_prompt": "A Post-Impressionism painting depicting a bright and cheerful afternoon scene with three contemporary toys arranged on a sun-dappled wooden surface. In the foreground, a medium-sized, warm red and bright white fishing boat, clean and well-maintained, sits beside a pristine medium-sized doll in soft pink and pale blue. The doll is positioned next to the fishing boat, creating a playful grouping. In the midground, a medium-sized sailboat in pure white with bright blue accents rests in excellent condition, completing the toy collection. The natural soft afternoon light casts gentle shadows and highlights the plastic, wood, porcelain, and fabric textures, creating an active yet gentle atmosphere with vibrant, expressive brushstrokes characteristic of Post-Impressionism.",
