The hide shimmers with warm amber and burnt sienna tones, absorbing the sunset's glow while deep violet shadows pool beneath the belly and legs.

The fleece absorbs the warm light, creating a gentle, glowing halo effect around the form.

The terracotta pot glows with warm, earthy orange, its rough texture visible in thick daubs of paint that catch the last rays.
