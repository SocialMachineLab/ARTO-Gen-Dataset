The petals show subtle variations of ivory, pale chartreuse, and the faintest lavender shadows where light passes through the translucent edges. Fresh and vibrant against the chapel's aged surfaces, the flower's glossy texture catches soft highlights, its pure white appearing almost luminous in the subdued atmosphere.",

The seat and back show visible wear patterns in lighter, polished wood, while the frame carries layers of faded varnish applied in visible strokes.

The surface shows decades of polish worn to a subtle sheen in seating areas, catching muted highlights from the chapel's diffuse natural light. Carved details and wood grain are simplified into bold, angular forms with visible brushwork in Prussian blue shadows and burnt umber ridges.
