On the same book's surface, near the urn's base, lies a marginal but vivid ruby red cherry with a forest green stem, appearing fresh and ripe. The bright yet subdued atmosphere feels both active and gentle, with visible brushstrokes and vibrant color blocks characteristic of Post-Impressionism, capturing the interplay of light and texture on ceramic, leather, paper, wood, and fruit surfaces in a cohesive, narrative composition.",
