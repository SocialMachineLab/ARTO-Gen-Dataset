The wet surface creates a lacquered effect, absorbing the moody shadows while reflecting pinpricks of amber light from nearby fixtures. The handle gleams with a dark metallic sheen, its polished surface creating subtle highlights that punctuate the enveloping darkness. The object stands as a stark silhouette, its form rendered with bold, deliberate strokes that emphasize its architectural structure against the atmospheric gloom.",
