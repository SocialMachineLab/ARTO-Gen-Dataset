The peel displays thick, impasto brushstrokes in brilliant cadmium yellow with touches of warm orange where the sun hits most directly, while the shaded areas show subtle greenish-yellow undertones. Tiny, dark pores create texture across the surface, and the stem end shows a small cluster of brownish-green.

The wood grain shows through layers of peeling paint in patches of faded red and natural wood tones, creating a rich tapestry of texture. Metal hardware gleams with sharp highlights of titanium white against deep shadows of Payne's gray. The wheels cast strong, warm-edged shadows on the floor, and the entire structure glows with a patina of age and use.",

The leather shows subtle variations in tone\u2014from reddish-brown in the light to near-black in crevices\u2014creating a sense of rich, tactile surface.

In the foreground, a large, well-used cart in weathered gray and burnt sienna sits prominently, its aged wood and iron hardware showing signs of sturdy use. Atop the cart rests a medium-sized, plump lemon in luminous cadmium yellow with warm orange-yellow tones, its waxy rind catching the harsh natural afternoon light. Beside the cart, a medium-sized book in burnt umber and golden brown lies gently worn, with softened corners and supple leather binding showing subtle gilt lettering. The composition uses bold, visible brushstrokes and vibrant, non-naturalistic colors to convey an active, cheerful atmosphere, with the harsh afternoon light creating dramatic shadows and highlights that enhance the scene's lively energy.",
