The fabric shows subtle variations in saturation, with areas of gentle wear creating softer, dusty rose highlights.

In the foreground, a large, well-maintained vintage armchair in deep burgundy leather sits beside a medium-sized contemporary reproduction side table of rich mahogany wood with muted brass accents. Resting atop the side table is a medium-sized, authentic antique saddle in warm chestnut and deep umber leather, its rich patina glowing in the afternoon light. The spatial arrangement creates a cohesive still life, with the armchair positioned next to the side table, which supports the saddle. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet, gentle activity, rendered with the characteristic expressive brushstrokes, vivid yet harmonious color palette, and emphasis on light and form typical of the Post-Impressionist style.",
