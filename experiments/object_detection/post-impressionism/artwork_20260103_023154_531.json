Next to the canoe, a medium-sized lamb in creamy white and pale butter wool sits quietly and serenely atop the back of a dominant, deep umber bull with burnt sienna tones, positioned behind the canoe. The bull stands still and contemplative, its living hide and horns textured with expressive brushstrokes, while the lamb's delicate features and soft wool contrast with the aged wood and peeling paint of the abandoned vessel. The natural dramatic lighting of the sunset casts long, warm shadows, creating a warm, peaceful, subdued, and striking atmosphere with vibrant, broken color fields and visible brushwork characteristic of the style.",
