The feathers are a mosaic of rich browns, burnt umbers, and deep rusts, with the cloudy daylight softening the contrasts and creating a gentle, matte appearance.

Behind the chair, a small clock in creamy white and deep indigo shows its age and tarnish, its enamel and brass elements catching the natural soft afternoon light. The spatial arrangement creates a dynamic composition where the chair dominates the foreground, the hen provides the foundational support, and the clock anchors the midground, all bathed in the gentle, diffused illumination of late afternoon with visible brushwork and vibrant color harmonies characteristic of the style.",
