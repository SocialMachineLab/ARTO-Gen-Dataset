The waxy skin catches the light with a high-gloss sheen, creating sharp specular highlights that contrast dramatically against deep, expressive shadows in the crevices. The surface displays subtle impasto-like texture where light scatters across natural imperfections, with warm golden-orange tones bleeding into the red where the sun strikes most directly. A single, cast shadow anchors it to the surface beneath, rendered in deep violet and cool blue tones that complement the warm fruit.",

The raw timber catches the light with a matte, slightly textured finish that absorbs and diffuses the illumination, while the metal hardware glints with sharp, silvery highlights. Strong shadows cast by the frame create dramatic dark passages in cobalt and indigo, emphasizing the structural forms. The wood shows contemporary craftsmanship with clean lines, its surface dusted with fine white highlights where chalk or pigment has settled.",
