        "main_prompt": "A Post-Impressionism painting depicting a bright and cheerful afternoon scene in a sun-drenched pasture. In the foreground, a large, warm cream and golden brown cow stands alert yet calm, its living hide and hair rendered with thick, expressive brushstrokes. A medium-sized blanket in deep crimson and warm ochre is freshly laid across the cow's broad back, its woolen texture suggested by visible, tactile paint. Beside the cow, in the midground, a small, vibrant yellow and pale green lemon rests on the grass, its firm, fresh citrus form providing a sharp, complementary color accent. The natural, harsh afternoon light creates strong contrasts and long, dancing shadows, casting the entire scene in a bright, active, and cheerful atmosphere, with the spatial relationships clearly showing the blanket on the cow and the lemon positioned next to it.",
