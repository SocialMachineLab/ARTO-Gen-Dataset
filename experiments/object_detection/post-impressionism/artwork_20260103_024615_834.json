                "artistic_description": "A wooden sleigh bathed in the warm, golden-orange glow of sunset, its surfaces glowing with rich amber and deep crimson tones. Fresh snow clings delicately to the runners and edges, creating soft white accents against the weathered wood. The paint is faded and chipped, revealing natural wood grain that catches the low light with a subtle, luminous quality. Moisture from melting snow creates gentle reflective patches that shimmer with the sunset's warmth. The metal hardware glints with coppery highlights, while shadows are long and violet-tinged, creating striking contrasts. The overall appearance has a painterly, textured quality with visible brushstrokes suggesting the rough, lived-in character of contemporary coastal life.",

In a Post-Impressionist style, the scene would focus on the emotional and visual impact of the snowy landscape, with the sleigh as a central, festive element.
