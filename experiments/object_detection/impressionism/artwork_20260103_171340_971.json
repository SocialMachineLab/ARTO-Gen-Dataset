The thick hide shows subtle variations of warm taupe and cool slate, with impressionistic brushstrokes suggesting the rough, wrinkled surface. Sunlight creates soft halos along the silhouette, while the shadowed areas hold deep purples and blues. The trunk appears as a fluid, expressive stroke of warm gray with highlights of pale gold where the sun glances off the moist surface.",

The transparent surface shows impressionistic swirls of refracted riverbank colors - warm greens, pale blues, and flashes of golden sand. Sunlight creates a luminous aura around the object, with the glass appearing almost liquid and ethereal. The label shows faded warm browns and soft creams, with edges softened by time and exposure.",
