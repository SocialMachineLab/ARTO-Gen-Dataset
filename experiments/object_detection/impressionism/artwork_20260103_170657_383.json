In the foreground, a toy-sized billiard table with an emerald green felt surface and russet brown wooden frame dominates the composition. Resting atop its smooth felt surface is a small, well-used comb with softened teeth, its warm amber and creamy gold tones catching the soft natural light. Beside the table, a medium-sized ripe banana with marigold yellow and saffron skin sits on the floor, its surface showing emerging brown spots. The gentle afternoon sunlight streams through a window, casting dappled shadows and creating a lively, active atmosphere where brushstrokes of color blend to suggest form rather than define it precisely. The overall mood is cheerful and gentle, with vibrant yet harmonious colors dancing across the canvas in typical Impressionist style.",
