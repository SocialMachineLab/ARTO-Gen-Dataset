Beside it rests a medium-sized, fresh and ripe pomegranate with glossy, intact crimson red skin of a deep ruby hue. The cheerful and gentle atmosphere is conveyed through loose, visible brushstrokes that capture the play of light on silk and fruit, with a vibrant, airy background suggesting a sunlit interior space full of life.",
