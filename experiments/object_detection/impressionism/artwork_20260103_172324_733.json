            "complex": "A Impressionism painting depicting a warm sunset scene with a large, weathered but functional lamp post of warm bronze and muted amber standing prominently in the midground. Resting atop the lamp post's horizontal arm is a small magazine in coral pink and soft gold, its pages slightly damp from atmospheric moisture. Beside the lamp post's base grows a marginal iris with deep violet and soft lavender petals, appearing fresh and vibrant against the subdued environment. The composition uses loose, visible brushstrokes to capture the mixed soft lighting of sunset, where long shadows blend with golden hour glow, creating a warm and peaceful atmosphere that feels both gentle and subdued. The foreground shows textured cobblestones catching the last light, while the background dissolves into hazy silhouettes of distant buildings and trees, all rendered with the characteristic Impressionist attention to light's transient effects on metal and glass surfaces, paper texture, and living petals.",
