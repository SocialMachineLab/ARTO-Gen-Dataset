        "main_prompt": "A Impressionism painting depicting a bright and active afternoon scene with a gentle, cheerful atmosphere. In the foreground, a large, alert mule stands in a dusty field, its warm brown and ochre fur catching the soft natural light. Balanced carefully on the mule's back is a medium-sized cake, its cream and pale gold surface appearing fresh and pristine. Beside the cake, nestled against its side, sits a medium-sized bowl of warm white and pale yellow ceramic, clean and dry. The spatial arrangement shows the cake resting atop the mule's back with the bowl positioned immediately adjacent to the cake. The entire scene is bathed in the golden-hued, diffused lighting of late afternoon, with loose, visible brushstrokes capturing the movement of light across the ceramic bowl, the textured food surface of the cake, and the dusty fur of the patient mule, creating a cohesive narrative of rustic preparation or celebration.",
