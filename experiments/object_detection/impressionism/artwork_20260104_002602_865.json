Her muscular form is rendered with loose, energetic strokes that suggest movement and speed. The natural lighting creates dappled patches of amber and chestnut across her sleek body, with bright white highlights on her shoulders and flank where the sun strikes directly. Her mane and tail flow like dark ribbons, rendered in quick, impressionistic dashes of deep brown and black. Steam rises from her exerted body in soft wisps, catching the light and creating ethereal halos around her form. Her eyes gleam with reflected light, and her nostrils flare with touches of pink and crimson.",

At dawn, the soft light is ideal for Impressionist painting, capturing the atmospheric quality of morning mist and light filtering through trees.
