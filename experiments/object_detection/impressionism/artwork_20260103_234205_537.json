The surface shows impressionistic dabs of deep burgundy and ruby where berry filling peeks through lattice vents. Steam rises in soft, wispy strokes of pale gray and white, dissolving into the crisp air. A glossy sheen on the crust catches scattered light with subtle highlights of pale yellow.

In the foreground, a large, weathered brown and white sleigh rests on the ground, its wood and metal construction showing signs of age but remaining functional.

Beside the sleigh, a medium-sized golden brown pie with deep red filling sits freshly baked, its pastry crust steaming slightly in the soft natural light.
