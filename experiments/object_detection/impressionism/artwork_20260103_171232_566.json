The cloudy sky creates a gentle, even illumination that softens the cup's edges, making it appear almost ethereal. A faint, warm glow from the interior lighting adds a whisper of cream and buttery yellow to the rim and handle, creating a subtle contrast against the cool natural light. The surface shows slight imperfections and a soft matte sheen from use, with light scattering gently across its curved form.",
