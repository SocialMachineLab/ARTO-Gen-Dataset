                "artistic_description": "A white enamel cooker glows softly under the mixed morning light, its surface alive with dappled sunlight streaming through the window. The warm golden rays dance across the metallic edges, creating gentle highlights of pale yellow and cream, while cooler shadows in soft blue-gray settle into the corners and handles. The stovetop burners show subtle variations of brushed steel, catching light with delicate impasto strokes that suggest both use and care. A faint patina of age appears as gentle variations in the enamel's sheen, giving the surface a lived-in, authentic quality. The chrome accents sparkle with tiny flecks of pure white and pale blue, reflecting the cheerful morning atmosphere.",
