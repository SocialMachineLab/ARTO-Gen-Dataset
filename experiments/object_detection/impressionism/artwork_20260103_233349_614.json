The metallic surface catches muted silvery highlights with subtle blue-gray reflections from the overcast atmosphere.

The cloudy atmosphere creates a gentle, even illumination without harsh shadows, allowing faint hints of warm ivory to emerge where the glaze pools.

The fruit's surface shows a complex interplay of cool highlights from the overcast sky and warm undertones from its natural color. Soft, matte texture absorbs and diffuses the gentle light, creating a velvety appearance.
