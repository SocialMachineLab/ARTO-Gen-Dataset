The porcelain surface appears slightly dewy, with tiny condensation beads clinging to its smooth curves, creating a gentle, matte sheen. Its fabric dress, once crisp, now shows faint water stains and a delicate fraying at the hem, blending into the forest's muted palette. The eyes, glassy and reflective, seem to hold a distant, dreamy quality, with the irises appearing as soft washes of blue-gray, almost dissolving into the mist.",

The feathers appear slightly damp, absorbing the cool light and showing subtle iridescent flashes where the fog thins. Its beak glints with a wet, metallic sheen, while the eyes are dark, bead-like points that seem to pierce the mist with a sharp, alert energy. The overall effect is one of soft edges and blended tones, as if the bird is emerging from and receding into the surrounding haze.",
