The rope cords appear as loose, impressionistic strokes of creamy white against the deep blue-gray shadows cast beneath.

The textured surface appears as a tapestry of impressionistic dabs and strokes, with deep crevices creating soft shadows of burnt umber. Steam rises in wispy, translucent curls that catch the bright light, appearing as soft white and pale lavender brushstrokes against the warm background. The flour-dusted edges catch the light as delicate, powdery highlights of pure white and pale cream",
