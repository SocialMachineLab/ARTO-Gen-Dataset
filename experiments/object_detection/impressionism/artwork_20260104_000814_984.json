            "complex": "A Impressionism painting depicting a bright and cheerful afternoon scene with natural soft lighting. In the foreground, a large fox in burnt sienna and golden ochre fur sits alert and lively beside a medium-sized sky blue and creamy white umbrella that stands open and pristine. Balanced delicately atop the umbrella's curved fabric surface rests a medium-sized peach, its warm coral and soft amber skin appearing fresh and ripe. The fox positions itself partially under the umbrella's shade, creating a gentle and active composition. The overall atmosphere is bright, active, cheerful, and gentle, with dappled afternoon light filtering through the scene and visible brushstrokes capturing the play of light on fur, fabric, and fruit.",
