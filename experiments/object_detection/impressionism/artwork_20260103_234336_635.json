            "complex": "A Impressionism painting depicting a late afternoon scene in a sun-dappled game room, where a large billiard table in excellent condition, covered in rich deep emerald and forest green felt, dominates the foreground. Resting upon its smooth wooden rails and leather-bound edges is a small, polished ball in muted crimson and dusty rose tones, appearing well-preserved and catching the soft light. Beside this ball sits a medium-sized glass jar of pristine clarity, its silvery-blue and pale aqua surfaces reflecting the gentle afternoon glow with subtle, shimmering highlights. The mixed soft lighting\u2014part direct sunlight through unseen windows, part diffused ambient glow\u2014creates a bright yet subdued atmosphere that feels both active in its play of light and gentle in its overall mood, with brushstrokes suggesting movement in the air and warmth in the wooden floorboards and walls.",
