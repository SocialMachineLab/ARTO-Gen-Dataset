                "artistic_description": "A porcelain cup rendered in soft, diffused natural light filtering through rain-streaked glass, its pristine white surface catching gentle ambient illumination with subtle cool blue-gray reflections from the overcast sky. Steam rises in wispy, translucent curls that dissolve into the moody air, while the cup's glossy glaze holds soft, scattered highlights where light grazes its curved form. The dark coffee within appears as a deep, velvety pool, its surface barely rippling with faint reflections. Moisture from the humid atmosphere clings to the exterior as delicate micro-droplets, creating a subtle, pearlescent sheen that blurs edges in an impressionistic haze. The overall effect is one of quiet intimacy\u2014warmth contained within cool surroundings\u2014captured in loose, visible brushstrokes that suggest form rather than define it.",
