            "simple": "An Impressionist painting of a toy plane on a bed frame with an antique cannon beside it in soft afternoon light.",
            "complex": "A Impressionism painting depicting a bright and active yet subdued and gentle afternoon scene, where a medium-sized toy plane in cool aluminum gray with muted crimson accents rests gently atop a large, well-maintained bed frame painted in soft silver-blue and cool gray. Beside the bed frame stands a medium-sized decorative antique cannon in charcoal gray with soft bronze highlights, its cast iron and bronze surfaces showing a gentle patina. The composition places the bed frame and plane in the foreground, with the cannon positioned slightly to the side in the midground, all bathed in natural soft afternoon light that creates dappled shadows and luminous highlights on the brushed steel and painted plastic surfaces. The atmosphere feels both lively and tranquil, with visible brushstrokes capturing the play of light across the gently weathered toy plane, the subtly aged bed frame, and the antique cannon, evoking a sense of nostalgic warmth and quiet activity.",
