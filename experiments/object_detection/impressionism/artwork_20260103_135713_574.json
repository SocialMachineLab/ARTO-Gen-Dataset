The lattice top creates delicate shadows that pattern the bubbling fruit filling below, visible as rich crimson and deep plum tones peeking through.

Loose, visible brushstrokes capture the dappled sunlight filtering through unseen foliage, casting gentle shadows and creating a vibrant interplay of light and color across the leather, steel, and pastry textures.

            "simple": "An Impressionist painting of a crimson ball on a silver sword with a golden pie beside it in a cheerful afternoon light.",
            "complex": "A Impressionism painting depicting a bright and active afternoon scene with a gentle, cheerful atmosphere. In the foreground, a large polished ceremonial sword with silver and steel-blue tones lies horizontally on a sun-dappled surface. Balanced precariously atop its flat blade is a medium-sized crimson and coral ball, its leather surface showing signs of being well-used but carefully maintained. Beside the sword, in the midground, sits a medium-sized freshly baked pie with a golden-brown and amber crust, its pastry surface steaming slightly in the soft natural afternoon light. The spatial arrangement creates a playful still life where the ball rests directly on the sword's blade while the pie sits adjacent to its hilt. Loose, visible brushstrokes capture the dappled sunlight filtering through unseen foliage, casting gentle shadows and creating a vibrant interplay of light and color across the leather, steel, and pastry textures. The overall mood is one of cheerful serenity, with the warm afternoon glow enhancing the coral of the ball, the cool steel-blue of the sword, and the rich amber of the pie in a harmonious, active composition.",
