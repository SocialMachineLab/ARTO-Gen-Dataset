The handle appears as broken strokes of warm amber and deep umber, suggesting polished wood with inlaid brass fittings that glimmer faintly. The metal surface shows gentle atmospheric haze, reducing harsh reflections while maintaining a cool, metallic sheen. Impressionistic brushwork suggests the knife's form through layered, visible strokes of muted grays, soft whites, and hints of golden warmth where light grazes the edge.",

The wool appears as textured strokes of creamy whites and pale grays, with subtle cool blue tones from the cloudy atmosphere. The surface shows a matte finish that absorbs rather than reflects light, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. Impressionistic technique uses broken color to suggest the fleece's texture through dabs of ivory, warm beige, and faint sage hints, capturing the subdued, gentle mood of the bright but soft-lit studio.",
