                "artistic_description": "Soft-edged wooden table rendered in loose, visible brushstrokes that dissolve the hard lines into atmospheric haze. The cloudy morning light filters through the window, bathing the surface in cool, diffused silver-gray tones with subtle hints of lavender and pale blue. The wood grain appears as rhythmic, broken dabs of warm ochre and sienna that peek through the cooler overtones, creating a vibrating color harmony. The matte finish absorbs rather than reflects light, giving the surface a velvety, chalky quality. Edges blur slightly into the surrounding air, as if the form is breathing with the gentle morning atmosphere. The contemporary design shows clean lines softened by the impressionistic treatment, with visible texture suggesting a well-used but cared-for piece.",
