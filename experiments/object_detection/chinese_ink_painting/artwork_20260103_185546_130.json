The cloudy morning light creates soft, diffused tones across its form, with subtle gradations suggesting the cool, gentle atmosphere. The coat shows delicate brushwork with wet-on-wet technique, creating organic patterns where ink naturally bleeds and spreads. Sparse, dry brush strokes define the muscular form, while the eyes are painted with a single dark dot, conveying serene contemplation. The hide appears matte and slightly damp from morning dew, absorbing rather than reflecting light, rendered with layered washes that build depth without harsh contrast. Fine stippling and controlled ink splatters suggest the texture of fur, softened by the subdued lighting of the overcast spring morning.",
