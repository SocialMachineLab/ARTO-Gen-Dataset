        "main_prompt": "A Chinese Ink Painting painting depicting a serene mountain courtyard in the soft afternoon light, where a large, well-used bed with a muted brown-gray and deep sepia patina rests directly beneath a medium-sized, weathered bench in soft gray and warm charcoal tones, slightly damp from mountain mist. Beside this intimate arrangement, a medium-sized swing in pale gray and warm brown-black hues hangs gently from an aged timber beam, its smooth, slightly weathered ropes swaying subtly. The spatial composition places the bench-and-bed combination in the foreground, with the swing occupying the midground, all set against a backdrop of mist-shrouded pine trees and distant mountain peaks. The natural, soft lighting of late afternoon creates a bright yet subdued atmosphere, where active brushstrokes suggest gentle movement in the air while maintaining the painting's overall gentle, contemplative mood, with washes of ink defining the aged wood textures and the play of light and shadow across the courtyard.",
