In the foreground, a large ivory and pale gray sheep grazes peacefully atop a medium-sized ochre and sage blanket, which is spread out across the surface of a stable, solid medium table in golden brown and umber tones. Directly behind the table stands a medium indigo and white umbrella, open and taut, casting a soft shadow. The natural soft afternoon light filters through, creating a luminous quality that highlights the textures of wool, fabric, and wood.
