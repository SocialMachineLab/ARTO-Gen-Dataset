                "artistic_description": "A stylized canine form rendered in traditional Chinese ink painting technique, with bold, expressive brushstrokes defining its silhouette against the snowy backdrop. The dog's fur appears as layered washes of diluted ink, creating soft gradations from deep charcoal to pale gray, suggesting steam rising from its warm body in the cold air. Its coat carries a matte, powdery texture that absorbs the cool morning light, while subtle dry-brush techniques create the illusion of snowflakes clinging to its fur. The animal's eyes are captured with a single decisive black dot, gleaming with alert energy. Steam breath mingles with falling snow, rendered as delicate white gouache splatters. The overall effect balances dynamic movement with serene presence, embodying the fresh morning atmosphere through the interplay of negative space and ink washes.",
