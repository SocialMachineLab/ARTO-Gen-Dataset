Its coat appears in soft gradations of gray and charcoal, the cloudy morning light creating a gentle, matte finish without harsh shadows. The mane and tail are suggested with swift, expressive strokes of darker ink, appearing slightly damp from morning moisture. Subtle wetness catches the cool natural light along the muscular contours, creating delicate highlights in pale silver-gray. The animal's form embodies both strength and serenity, with ink washes building volume through atmospheric perspective.",

The cloudy morning light softens its natural vibrancy into a muted, earthy orange with subtle brown undertones. The surface shows delicate ink stippling suggesting texture, with a gentle sheen from morning dew making it appear slightly luminous against the subdued background. A single leaf at its stem is painted in a darker sage wash, appearing fresh and slightly translucent in the cool, humid air.",

The object appears weathered and softened by time, with ink washes that have bled slightly into the porous surface.

The spatial arrangement creates depth: the orange sits adjacent to the toy in the midground, while the horse looms gracefully behind them both, its head slightly lowered. The atmosphere is fresh and energetic yet simultaneously subdued and gentle, achieved through delicate ink gradations that suggest morning mist and the subtle interplay of light and shadow. Loose, flowing brushstrokes define the horse's muscular form, while finer details capture the orange's textured skin and the toy's worn wooden or ceramic surface, all unified by the harmonious monochromatic palette of traditional ink painting.",

            "simple": "A Chinese ink painting of a horse behind an orange and a toy in a soft morning light.",
            "complex": "A Chinese Ink Painting painting depicting a tranquil morning scene with soft natural light filtering through. In the foreground, a small, fresh and ripe orange with muted orange and earthy brown tones rests beside a marginal, well-loved and slightly worn toy in faded red and soft gray. Positioned behind both objects, a large charcoal gray and silver-gray horse stands alert yet calm, its powerful form rendered with expressive ink washes that capture the texture of living flesh and hair. The spatial arrangement creates depth: the orange sits adjacent to the toy in the midground, while the horse looms gracefully behind them both, its head slightly lowered. The atmosphere is fresh and energetic yet simultaneously subdued and gentle, achieved through delicate ink gradations that suggest morning mist and the subtle interplay of light and shadow. Loose, flowing brushstrokes define the horse's muscular form, while finer details capture the orange's textured skin and the toy's worn wooden or ceramic surface, all unified by the harmonious monochromatic palette of traditional ink painting.",
