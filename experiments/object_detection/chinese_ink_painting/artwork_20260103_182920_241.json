The wood grain appears as delicate brushstrokes, slightly muted by the subdued indoor light. Edges are softly defined with minimal ink outlines, creating a gentle, contemplative presence.

The wheels and frame show subtle variations in tone where cloudy natural light catches the edges, creating soft highlights in lighter gray washes.
