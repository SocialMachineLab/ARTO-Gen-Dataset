The material appears as delicate washes of pale gray and subtle blue tones, with ink-brushed textures suggesting fine weave. Moisture-laden air causes the fabric to hang with gentle weight, its surface catching muted highlights where light penetrates the thin material. The edges dissolve into soft, gradated strokes typical of ink painting, creating an ethereal, breathing quality that embodies the fresh yet subdued atmosphere.",
