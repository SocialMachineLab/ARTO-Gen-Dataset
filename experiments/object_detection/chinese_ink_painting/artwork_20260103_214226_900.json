The blade appears cool-toned with faint blue-gray undertones, while the ornate guard and pommel are suggested with darker, concentrated ink strokes that create a sense of aged brass or bronze with a muted patina. The metallic surfaces absorb the gentle, subdued atmosphere, showing minimal highlights but a quiet, contemplative gleam that speaks to the bright yet restrained energy of the tea house.",

The surface shows gentle variations in ink saturation, suggesting a matte, slightly weathered finish that absorbs rather than reflects the ambient brightness. Subtle dry-brush techniques reveal the wood's texture, while the overall tone carries warm gray undertones that harmonize with the tea house's bright yet subdued atmosphere. The edges are softened by time, with faint washes indicating dust particles dancing in the diffused natural light.",

The fur is suggested through varied ink washes\u2014lighter, diluted grays on the back where soft afternoon light falls, and deeper, concentrated strokes in shadowed areas. The eyes are rendered with a single dark dot that gleams with quiet awareness, reflecting the subdued indoor brightness. The overall form appears soft and contemplative, with wet-on-wet techniques creating a sense of fluffy texture that seems to breathe with the gentle energy of the space.",

In the foreground, a large, aged table of warm dark brown-gray wood, its surface showing the soft charcoal tones of years of use, dominates the composition. Resting centrally upon this well-used table is a medium-sized ceremonial sword, its cool steel gray blade and muted bronze fittings polished to a gentle sheen. Beside the table, in the midground, sits a small dog with soft gray and deep black fur, its posture alert yet peaceful as it watches the room. The scene is bathed in natural, soft afternoon light that filters through a paper window, creating a bright and active interplay of light and shadow that feels both subdued and gentle. The ink washes define the space with masterful economy, suggesting shelves of books and scrolls in the background, with the textures of metal, wood, and fur rendered through expressive brushstrokes and subtle gradations of ink.",
