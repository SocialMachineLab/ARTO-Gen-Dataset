In the foreground, a large sheep stands calmly with its fleece slightly damp, rendered in warm gray and charcoal ink washes. Next to the sheep sits a small toy, its muted ochre and soft brown colors appearing slightly faded and weathered from outdoor exposure. Resting on the sheep's back is a pair of scissors, marginal in size with steel gray and deep black tones showing slight surface oxidation. The spatial arrangement shows the toy positioned beside the sheep's front legs, while the scissors lie gently atop the sheep's woolen fleece, creating a harmonious composition of wool, wood, and metal textures. The ink brushwork captures the active yet peaceful moment with flowing lines and subtle gradations of ink, evoking traditional Chinese landscape sensibilities in a domestic setting.",
