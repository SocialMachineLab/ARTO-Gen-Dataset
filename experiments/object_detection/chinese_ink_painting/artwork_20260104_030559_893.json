        "main_prompt": "A Chinese Ink Painting painting depicting a quiet afternoon scene where a medium-sized, thriving potted plant with emerald green leaves and an ochre ceramic pot sits beside a large, well-maintained spear of iron gray and charcoal, its keen edge catching the soft natural light. Next to the potted plant rests a medium-sized, meticulously crafted wagon in weathered brown and dark umber wood, showing artisan craftsmanship. The spatial arrangement forms a gentle triangle: the potted plant is positioned next to the spear, the wagon is placed next to the potted plant, and the spear stands next to the wagon, creating a balanced composition in the midground. The atmosphere is bright and active yet subdued and gentle, with soft afternoon lighting casting delicate shadows and highlighting the dew-fresh foliage of the plant, the functional steel of the spear, and the textured wood of the wagon, all rendered in expressive ink washes and subtle tonal variations.",
