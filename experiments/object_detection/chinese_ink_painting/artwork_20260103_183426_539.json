The composition is bathed in natural soft afternoon light that filters through, creating a bright and active yet simultaneously subdued and gentle atmosphere. The ink washes capture the organic textures of the fruit, wood, and fabric with flowing brushstrokes, emphasizing the spatial relationship where the cherries sit atop the table while the umbrella stands adjacent, all harmonized within the tranquil setting.",
