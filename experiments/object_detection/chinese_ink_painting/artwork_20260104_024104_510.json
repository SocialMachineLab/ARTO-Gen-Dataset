Her expression carries quiet contemplation, with ink tones varying from deep charcoal to delicate diluted washes that capture the subdued atmosphere. Hair is suggested with swift, dark strokes, while clothing folds are indicated with economical brushwork that follows natural draping.",

The fabric appears warm and inviting despite the cool natural lighting, with brushstrokes that flow in organic patterns following the material's natural drape.

The animal's coat is suggested through varied ink densities, from dry-brushed textures that suggest rough fur to smooth washes on rounded surfaces.

The creature's powerful build is suggested through confident brushwork that varies from thick, dark lines defining contours to lighter gray washes filling in muscular forms.
