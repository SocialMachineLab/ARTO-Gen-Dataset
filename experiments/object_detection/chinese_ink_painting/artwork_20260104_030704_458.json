The artificial lighting creates stark contrasts between rich black ink pools and dry-brushed gray washes, while the decorative surface shows subtle texture variations that absorb and soften the light. Traditional ink painting techniques emphasize the bat's symbolic form through minimal, powerful brushwork that embodies the moody, contemplative atmosphere.",
