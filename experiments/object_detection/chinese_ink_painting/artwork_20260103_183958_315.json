The drizzle creates subtle highlights along its muscular back and flanks, where water beads form tiny mirrors reflecting the pale sky. Its silhouette is softened by atmospheric moisture, with edges bleeding slightly into the misty air.

The drizzle creates a fine sheen of moisture across its surface, transforming the matte ceramic into a slightly reflective canvas. Ink washes show the bottle's form through graduated tones from solid black at the base to lighter gray at the shoulder, where water droplets create tiny distortion effects. The glaze appears cool and smooth, with the overcast sky reflected in muted silver tones across its wet surface.",
