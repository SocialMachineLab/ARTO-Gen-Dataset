The morning fog softens its edges, creating a dreamy, ethereal quality as if emerging from mist. Subtle gradations of diluted ink suggest the fresh morning light diffusing through the fog, with wet-on-wet techniques creating organic, flowing textures in the fur. The creature appears energized yet serene, captured in a moment of quiet contemplation within the mountain landscape.",
