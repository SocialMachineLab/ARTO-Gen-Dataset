                "artistic_description": "A tall, slender ceramic bottle rendered in traditional Chinese ink painting style with varying washes of black and gray ink. The morning fog diffuses natural light, creating soft, ethereal edges that gradually fade into the mist. Subtle gradations of ink wash suggest moisture condensed on the cool ceramic surface. The neck shows delicate brushwork capturing fine cracks in the glaze, while the body displays a deeper, more saturated ink tone where light penetrates the thin ceramic. Dry brush technique on the base suggests dust settled from the temple's ancient air. The overall appearance balances the fresh morning energy with the mysterious, gentle atmosphere of the foggy sanctuary.",
