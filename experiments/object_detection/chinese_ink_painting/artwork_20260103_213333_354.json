The natural, soft afternoon illumination filters through unseen windows, casting gentle shadows and creating a bright, active yet simultaneously subdued and gentle atmosphere, where the textures of aged hardwood, iron, steel, and aged bronze materials are suggested through masterful ink washes and deliberate brushstrokes that capture both the stillness of the artifacts and the quiet energy of the museum space.",
