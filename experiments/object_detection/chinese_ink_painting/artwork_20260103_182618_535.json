The bottle is rendered in pale celadon and wet slate gray tones, its ceramic surface wet and gleaming with morning dew. Beside this bottle stands a large potted plant with deep sage and charcoal green foliage, its leaves glistening with recent rain. The spatial arrangement places the mouse-bottle pair in the midground, with the potted plant slightly offset to create visual balance. Natural soft morning light filters through, casting delicate shadows and illuminating the textures of fur, ceramic, and living foliage. The atmosphere is fresh and energetic yet gentle, captured through the flowing brushstrokes and subtle ink washes characteristic of traditional Chinese ink painting, with misty background elements suggesting a tranquil garden setting.",
