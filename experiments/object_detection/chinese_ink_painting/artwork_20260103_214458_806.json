The cloudy light reflects softly across its curved surface, creating subtle tonal variations from pale silver-gray to deeper slate. A hint of warm undertone peeks through the cool gray washes, suggesting the glaze's depth. The rim catches a delicate highlight, while the interior shadow holds a concentrated pool of darker ink.",
