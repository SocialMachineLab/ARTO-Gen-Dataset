The edges appear slightly softened with moisture absorption, while the center retains a luminous quality where diffused dawn light penetrates the thin paper fibers. Fine brushstroke textures suggest the plate's woven paper grain, with gentle atmospheric haze reducing contrast and creating ethereal, dreamlike edges that dissolve into the misty environment.",
