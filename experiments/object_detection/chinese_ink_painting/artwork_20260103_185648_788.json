The crest is slightly raised, captured with delicate brushstrokes that suggest movement. The beak shows a warm ivory tone, softened by the diffuse natural lighting, while the eye is a single precise dot of black ink, sharp and alert. The overall appearance is fresh and energetic yet subdued, with gentle ink bleeding that creates organic, flowing edges.",

The fleece appears as layered gray brushstrokes, ranging from wet, dark pools of ink at the shadowed areas to dry, lighter tones where the cloudy morning light illuminates the form. The wool has a matte, absorbent quality that softens the edges, creating a gentle, cloud-like appearance. Subtle variations in ink density suggest the softness and depth of the fleece, with occasional fine lines defining the contours.

The surface shows subtle gradations from medium gray to pale mist tones, reflecting the diffuse cloudy morning light. The ink has been applied with varying moisture levels, creating both smooth washes and textured areas where the brush has lifted, suggesting a matte, absorbent fabric surface.
