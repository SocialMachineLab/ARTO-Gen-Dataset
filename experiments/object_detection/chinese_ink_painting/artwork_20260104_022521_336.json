The morning mist softens its silhouette, creating ethereal edges where black ink bleeds into the white paper.

The morning fog creates a soft halo around the sharp edges, while natural light catches the polished blades, suggesting a cool blue-gray reflection.

The morning light diffuses through the mist, creating a luminous quality where the white paper shows through sparse ink washes on its body. Its coat is suggested through varied ink tones, with the fog softening all edges into gentle gradations.
