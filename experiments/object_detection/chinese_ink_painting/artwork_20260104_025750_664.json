Adjacent to the table rests a medium-sized bench in medium brown and soft gray-brown hues, its functional form weathered to a smooth patina. The sheep occupies the foreground, its living wool and flesh rendered with expressive ink washes, while the dining table and bench form the midground, their aged hardwood and solid wood textures suggested through masterful brushstrokes. Natural soft morning light filters through the composition, creating a fresh, energetic, and gentle atmosphere where ink gradients transition from deep blacks to subtle grays, capturing the tranquil spatial relationships between the quiet animal and the domestic objects in harmonious balance.",
