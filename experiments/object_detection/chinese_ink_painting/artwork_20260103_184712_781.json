Beside the armchair rests a small cat, its soft black and pale gray fur depicted with delicate brushwork, appearing alert yet relaxed. The composition arranges the armchair and its occupant in the midground, with the bull looming gently in the background, and the cat in the immediate foreground, creating a layered depth. The scene is set in a soft morning light, with natural illumination filtering through to cast gentle shadows and highlight the textures of fabric, aged wood, animal hide, and fur. The overall atmosphere is fresh and energetic, yet carries a mysterious and gentle tranquility, achieved through the masterful use of ink gradations, expressive brushstrokes, and deliberate empty space characteristic of the style.",
