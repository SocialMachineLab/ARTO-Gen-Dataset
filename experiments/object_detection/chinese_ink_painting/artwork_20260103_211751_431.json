        "main_prompt": "A Chinese Ink Painting painting depicting a tranquil morning scene where a large, charcoal-black mule with warm gray highlights stands alert and vital in the foreground, its powerful form rendered with expressive brushstrokes that capture its living hide and hair. Positioned next to the mule in the midground is a medium-sized sign of light gray wood with deep black, clean and readable characters, leaning gently against the animal's side. Beside the mule's front hooves rests a small pair of scissors, their steel-black blades and silver-white edges appearing functional and sharp against the earth. The composition flows from foreground to background with soft, natural morning light filtering through mist, creating a fresh, energetic, and gentle atmosphere where ink washes suggest distant mountains and sparse vegetation, all unified by the rhythmic balance of empty space and ink.",
