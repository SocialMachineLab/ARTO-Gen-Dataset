Behind the armchair stands a stationary medium-sized swing in soft gray and near-white tones, its clean wood and metal frame contrasting with the organic materials. The composition uses flowing ink washes and deliberate negative space to create a bright yet subdued atmosphere that feels both active in its arrangement and gentle in its execution, capturing the quiet energy of an afternoon moment through traditional brushwork and tonal gradations.",
