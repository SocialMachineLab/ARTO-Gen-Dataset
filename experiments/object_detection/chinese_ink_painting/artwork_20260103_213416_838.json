The wood appears dry and matte, absorbing light rather than reflecting it, with subtle variations in tone suggesting years of quiet service.",

The feathers are suggested through layered washes of deep black and charcoal, with dry brush techniques creating texture and depth. The form emerges from the shadows with powerful presence, eyes rendered as sharp, focused dots that capture the dim light.
