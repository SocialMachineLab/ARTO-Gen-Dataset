The petals appear velvety and slightly translucent under the cool, diffused morning light filtering through clouds. Gentle ink strokes capture the delicate curling edges of petals, with darker, concentrated ink at the crevices creating depth. The flower head shows a gentle droop, suggesting morning dew, with fine brushwork detailing the delicate veining on petals. Soft, muted grays dominate with hints of warm sepia at the center, creating a harmonious balance that embodies the fresh yet subdued atmosphere.",
