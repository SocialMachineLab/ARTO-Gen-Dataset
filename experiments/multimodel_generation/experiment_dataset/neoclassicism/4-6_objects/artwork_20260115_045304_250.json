The polished wood surface reflects the cheerful atmosphere with deep amber tones and rich grain patterns visible in the strong natural light.",

The golden-brown crust peeks through at the edges, glowing with warm honey tones. Delicate sugar decorations catch the light with a subtle sheen, while the soft, matte texture of the frosting absorbs and diffuses the sunlight, creating gentle highlights on its rounded form.",

The metal surface is mirror-like and cold, creating sharp specular reflections of the cheerful room. The wooden handle shows fine grain details in warm tones, while the steel itself appears cool and silvery in the natural light, with a dangerous gleam that contrasts with the domestic warmth.",
