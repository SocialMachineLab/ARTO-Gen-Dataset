        "artistic_description": "A sumptuous wool blanket draped in soft folds, its surface catching the muted afternoon light filtering through library windows. The fabric exhibits a subtle sheen where the cloudy daylight grazes its textured weave, creating gentle highlights and shadows that speak to classical drapery techniques. The blanket's edges show delicate fringe detailing, each thread rendered with neoclassical precision against the subdued atmosphere. The material appears warm and inviting, its natural fibers absorbing and diffusing the cool, overcast light into a soft, luminous quality.",
