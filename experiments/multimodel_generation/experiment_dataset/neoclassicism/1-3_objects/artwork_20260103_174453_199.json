        "artistic_description": "A grand neoclassical bench carved from dark walnut, its polished surface catching the warm glow of gaslight sconces in rich amber highlights. The ornate classical pilasters and acanthus leaf carvings cast deep, dramatic shadows across the seat, while the velvet upholstery in deep crimson absorbs the ambient light, appearing almost black in the dimmer recesses. The brass tacks along the frame gleam with a soft, muted patina, reflecting flickering candlelight.",

The muscular form is rendered with classical precision, the polished high points catching warm candlelight while the textured fur details hold cool, shadowed tones. The patinated surface reflects light in complex, jewel-like facets, creating a striking contrast between the dark, mossy crevices and the luminous highlights.",
