    "main_prompt": "A Post-Impressionism painting depicting a bright and active afternoon interior scene. In the foreground, a large, well-used but cherished burgundy and burnt orange velvet armchair with a wooden frame sits next to a dominant honey amber and golden brown polished dining table, gently worn with visible use marks. On the armchair, a small cat with deep black fur and violet undertones is curled comfortably in a patch of harsh natural sunlight. Beside the armchair, a medium-sized golden brown and ochre dog appears alert and content. On the dining table's surface rests a small, meticulously crafted decorative model fishing boat with weathered white and faded blue painted wood and metal fittings. The composition uses bold, visible brushstrokes and vibrant, non-naturalistic colors to convey a cheerful atmosphere, with the harsh afternoon light creating dramatic shadows and highlights across the scene.",
