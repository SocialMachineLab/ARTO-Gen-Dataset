Beside the bed stands a small donkey in toy form, depicted in medium gray with dark accents. At the center, a medium-sized vase in soft white-gray with muted black tones holds a small orange in warm amber and pale apricot hues, fresh and ripe, while a marginal cherry in deep crimson-black with a soft highlight rests nearby. Next to the vase, a clean and well-maintained medium blade in cool silver-gray and deep black leans against a small empty bottle in translucent gray with clear highlights, which sits atop the vase. The composition flows with the fluid brushstrokes and ink washes characteristic of traditional Chinese ink painting, capturing the active yet gentle interplay of light and shadow in the afternoon.",
