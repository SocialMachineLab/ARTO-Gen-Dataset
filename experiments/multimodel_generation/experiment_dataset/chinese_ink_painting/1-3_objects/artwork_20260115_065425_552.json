        "artistic_description": "A slender, single-edged blade rendered in deep, wet ink washes that fade from near-black at the hilt to ghostly gray at the tip, as if dissolving into the fog. The blade's surface is matte and slightly blurred by atmospheric moisture, with subtle ink splatters suggesting mist clinging to the metal. A single, sharp highlight in warm sepia catches the last rays of sunset, creating a striking contrast against the cool, muted tones of the surrounding mist. The guard and pommel are suggested with minimal, decisive brushstrokes, their details softened and obscured by the ethereal, mysterious atmosphere.",
        "size": "Medium",
        "state": "Ancient but well-preserved, its edge still keen, weathered by time and the elements, standing as a silent testament in the dragon's lair.",
