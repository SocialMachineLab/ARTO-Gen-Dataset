        "artistic_description": "A weathered wooden bench rendered in soft gradations of ink wash, its surface appearing damp and slightly reflective in the foggy morning light. The wood grain shows through subtle brushstrokes, with edges softly diffused by mist. Morning condensation creates darker patches where moisture has settled, appearing as deeper ink tones against the lighter, drier sections. The bench's surface has a matte finish that absorbs the cool, diffused light, giving it a gentle, ethereal quality.",
