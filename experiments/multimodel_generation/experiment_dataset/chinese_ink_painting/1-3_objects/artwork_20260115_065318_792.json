        "artistic_description": "A soft plush teddy bear rendered in traditional Chinese ink painting style, its brown fur appearing as layered washes of sepia and warm sienna tones under the mixed afternoon light filtering through the window. The plush texture is captured through delicate stippling and varied ink density, with subtle highlights on the curved surfaces where warm window light catches the fabric. Its black button eyes gleam with a small dot of white reflection, while the muzzle shows gentle gradations from light tan to deeper umber shadows. The toy shows slight wear on its seams with frayed threads rendered in fine, wispy brushstrokes, suggesting years of affectionate handling. A soft matte finish dominates the fabric surface, absorbing light rather than reflecting it, creating a gentle, contemplative presence. The overall effect balances the warm indoor ambient light with cooler shadows, embodying the harmonious atmosphere through careful ink gradation and empty space integration.",

The composition is balanced and harmonious, with the upper toy slightly off-center, creating a gentle vertical axis. Soft, mixed afternoon light filters through a subtle haze, casting delicate shadows and highlighting the textures of the fabric.
