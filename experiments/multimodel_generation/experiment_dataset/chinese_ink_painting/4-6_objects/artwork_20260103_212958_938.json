      "complex": "A Chinese Ink Painting painting depicting a bright and active yet gentle afternoon scene in a contemporary studio. In the foreground, a large, solid and functional contemporary wooden table in warm medium gray and dark charcoal tones dominates the composition. On its surface rests a medium-sized, clean and well-maintained contemporary bottle in warm gray and pale silver, positioned next to a small, fresh contemporary calendar with crisp pages in off-white and charcoal gray. A small, alert and vibrant bird in soft gray and deep black perches on the table near the other objects. To the side, a medium-sized, well-used but sturdy contemporary wooden stool in medium gray-brown and dark gray stands next to the table. The scene is bathed in natural soft afternoon light, creating a bright atmosphere where the textures of ceramic, paper, and wood are suggested through masterful ink washes and expressive brushstrokes.",
