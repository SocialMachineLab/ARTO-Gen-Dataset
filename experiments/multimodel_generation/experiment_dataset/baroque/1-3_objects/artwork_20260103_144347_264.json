        "artistic_description": "A richly ornate wheel with elaborate Baroque scrollwork and gilded accents, its wooden spokes carved with acanthus leaves and volutes. Under the bright, cool natural light filtering through high windows, the aged wood displays warm amber tones with subtle gray shadows in the crevices. The metal rim gleams with a soft, muted silver sheen, while the decorative bronze fittings catch the daylight with gentle highlights. Fine dust motes dance in the luminous shafts, revealing the wheel's weathered patina and the delicate tracery of age lines in the wood grain.",

        "artistic_description": "An elegant Baroque canoe with gracefully curved lines and richly carved ornamentation along its gunwales, featuring flowing scrollwork and shell motifs. The polished wooden hull reflects the cloudy daylight with a soft, luminous glow, revealing deep mahogany tones that shift to chocolate brown in the recessed carvings. Its surface is smooth and dry, absorbing the gentle, diffused light with a satin finish that emphasizes the wood's natural luster. Delicate brass fittings add touches of warm gold, while the interior shows subtle variations in the wood's patina, suggesting careful use in refined settings.",
