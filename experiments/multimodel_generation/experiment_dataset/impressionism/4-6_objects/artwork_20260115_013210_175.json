'Side-lit' lighting is chosen to create depth and shadows on the counter objects (bowl, tray, toys), highlighting their forms. 'Soft' quality refers to the diffused nature of light inside a room, avoiding harsh shadows, which allows for the blending of colors typical of the style. 'Warm' mood is selected to evoke a cozy, domestic atmosphere."
