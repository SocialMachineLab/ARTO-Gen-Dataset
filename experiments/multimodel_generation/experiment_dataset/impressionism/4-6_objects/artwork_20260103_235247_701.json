The natural light reveals subtle variations in the glaze, with warm golden tones dancing across its curved form, while the unlit areas hold cool, gentle shadows. The Impressionist treatment shows loose, visible brushstrokes that capture the fleeting play of light, making the surface appear alive with shimmering reflections.",

The polished metal surface acts as a mirror, reflecting the cheerful atmosphere of the sunlit shop with cool, silvery highlights.

The natural illumination reveals the subtle texture of cotton fibers, with soft shadows creating gentle depth in the folds. Impressionist brushwork captures the airy quality of the fabric, using loose strokes of ivory, pale yellow, and whisper-soft gray to convey its fresh, clean appearance.",

The natural illumination reveals the fuzzy, tactile quality of the weave, with sunlit areas glowing in gentle golden tones while recessed folds hold deeper, cooler grays. The Impressionist treatment uses thick, visible strokes of ochre, sienna, and soft blue to capture the fabric's comforting weight and the way light plays across its napped surface.",

To fit the 'Impressionism' style, the lighting should be filtered or diffused to create soft edges and blend colors, rather than harsh contrasts.
