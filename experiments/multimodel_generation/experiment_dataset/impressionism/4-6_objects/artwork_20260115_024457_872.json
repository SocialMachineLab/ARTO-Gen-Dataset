Perched atop the stool is a medium, warm ochre and amber cat, alert yet relaxed. Beside the cat, a medium, deep emerald and olive bottle, partially filled, stands next to a small, fresh, crimson cherry. A small, well-loved toy horse cart in cobalt blue and cadmium red with chipped paint sits on the stool, adjacent to the bottle. A medium, burnt sienna and gray-blue dog sits attentively on the stool, positioned next to the cat. The scene is bathed in the soft, natural light of an afternoon, creating a bright yet subdued and gentle atmosphere.",
