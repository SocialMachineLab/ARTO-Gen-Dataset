    "main_prompt": "A Impressionism painting depicting a fresh and energetic morning scene with soft natural lighting. In the foreground, a majestic and still bison in deep umber and charcoal stands as the dominant figure, its woolly coat catching the gentle morning light. Nearby, a creamy white lamb with pale gray accents rests softly on the grass, its young form positioned beside an alert and active hen in warm chestnut and golden russet feathers. Perched atop the hen's back rests a ripe banana in buttery yellow with muted green accents, and balanced delicately on the banana is a small, well-used comb in translucent pink and cool ivory. Behind this central group, a large and fully bloomed sunflower in vibrant yellow with a deep umber center rises tall, its petals framing both the hen and lamb. The cheerful and gentle atmosphere is enhanced by dappled morning light filtering through the air, with loose brushstrokes capturing the textures of feathers, wool, fruit peel, and plant matter in a cohesive, lively composition.",
