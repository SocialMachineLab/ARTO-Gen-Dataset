The unlit lamp head catches faint ambient light as a muted bronze oval, while the post's vertical form creates a strong dark silhouette against the cloudy sky.

The cloudy evening light softens shadows across its rounded flank, creating subtle variations of burnt sienna and raw umber. A gentle cool blue-gray tone diffuses across the darker areas, while the moist muzzle and eyes catch faint reflected light as small highlights. The animal's patient stillness is captured through broad, confident strokes that build volume without harsh edges.",
